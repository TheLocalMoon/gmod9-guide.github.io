# LAN
In order to play using LAN, you either need to use real LAN (be near right to each other), or use the [Hamachi](https://vpn.net) tool.
### Hamachi
In order to play lan using Hamachi, you must install it. Open the link, and click on the Download now button, open the installer and follow the instructions. When you have installed *Hamachi*, you need to open it, and click on the power on button. It may ask you to log in, you need to log in/sign in.
#### Host
In order to host a LAN game, you need to click on the Network tab (in the app, of course), and click on "Create a new network" (not the exact translation to English), then put the name and password of the network (make sure to remember it), and now you can invite people to play. In order to make a LAN server, open GMOD 9, click on the Create Server button, fill everything how you want to and start playing. It's that easy!
#### Join
In order to join a LAN game, you need to click on the Network tab (in the app, of course), and click on "Join a existing network" (not the exact translation to English), fill the name and password field, and if it's correct, you can start playing. Open GMOD 9, click on Server Broswer/Find Servers button, in the server browser, click on the LAN tab, and find the server you want to play in. It's that easy!
