# Downloading
Garry's Mod 9 is available for free on these sources (well, actually it's free on everywhere, i just listed those sources that you could trust, because you can get a virus from other sources):

- [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/garrys-mod/downloads/gmod-904)
- [gmod9.com (fixed)](https://gmod9.com/download)
  
In order to install, you need to have the **Source SDK Base 2006**, not above because it won't work. It is available in Steam, but not in the Steam store, in your Library. In the search field, search for "*Source SDK Base 2006*", and click download/install. After you installed, do the following:
### ModDB
Open the installer, and follow the instructions to install the mod. Just install it into your "*sourcemods*" folder in the steam/steamapps thing.
### gmod9.com
Just drag the folder from the archive to your "*sourcemods*" folder in the steam/steamapps thing.


After you have done the procedure, you also need to put in the launch options of **Source SDK Base 2006** the following:
`-game "(path to gmod 9 here) -novid"`, where the *(path to gmod 9 here)* is the directory you are storing your Garry's Mod 9 in. And when you have done that, just run the game and BOOM! It works!
