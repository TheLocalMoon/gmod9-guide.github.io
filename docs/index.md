## Basics
Garry's Mod 9, shortened as GMOD 9, is a mod for Half-Life 2, but doesn't actually require it to run, even though some textures will be bugged.
### History
GMOD was created in December 2004, by **Garry Newman**, while he was experimenting with the Source engine physics. In 2006, Garry's Mod became a official game available in Steam, but right now we're talking about **Garry's Mod 9**, which was made in 2005, and was the last version of GMOD to be free.
### Features
* Lua programming language support (for modding)
* Editing (you can make GMOD 9 - LMOD)
* Realistic physics (thanks to Half-Life 2!)
